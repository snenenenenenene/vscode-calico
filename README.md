# üê± Calico Theme for VS Code

Inspired by my beloved calico cat Delilah, this theme brings the beautiful contrast and warmth of calico cat colors to your coding environment. Just as Delilah brightens my day with her unique patches of orange, black, and white fur (with hints of green eyes!), this theme aims to make your coding experience both visually pleasing and highly readable.

This theme has been crafted with special attention to TypeScript and JavaScript, with careful consideration for other languages as well.

## Color Philosophy

Just like Delilah's distinctive coat patterns, this theme features:
- Pure blacks for core syntax (like her black patches)
- Warm oranges for constants and types (like her orange spots)
- Clean whites for the background (like her white fur)
- Forest greens for strings (inspired by her beautiful eyes)
