# üê± Calico Theme for VS Code

Inspired by my beloved calico cat Delilah, this theme brings the beautiful contrast and warmth of calico cat colors to your coding environment. Just as Delilah brightens my day with her unique patches of orange, black, and white fur (with hints of green eyes!), this theme aims to make your coding experience both visually pleasing and highly readable.

## Theme Variants

The Calico theme comes in six beautiful variants to suit your preferences:

- **Calico Light Flat** - A clean, flat design with light background
- **Calico Dark Flat** - A modern, flat design with dark background
- **Calico Light** - Classic light theme with subtle shadows and depth
- **Calico Dark** - Rich dark theme with dimensional elements
- **Calico Light High Contrast** - Enhanced contrast for accessibility
- **Calico Dark High Contrast** - Maximum contrast for low-light conditions

## Color Philosophy

Just like Delilah's distinctive coat patterns, this theme features:
- Pure blacks for core syntax (like her black patches)
- Warm oranges for constants and types (like her orange spots)
- Clean whites for the background (like her white fur)
- Subtle browns and beiges for accents (like her tortoiseshell patterns)
